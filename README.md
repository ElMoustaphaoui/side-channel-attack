# About :

>In computer security, a side-channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the implementation of a computer system, 
rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself (e.g. cryptanalysis and software bugs). Timing information, 
power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sound can provide an extra source of information, which can be exploited.

# Structure : 

This project contains : 
- A detailed [report](./Cryptographie_et_s√©curit__informatique_rapport_final.pdf) of studied topics to realise this simution of time attack
- The [simulation](./TimeAttack.py) of the Time attack using python and some assembley instructions

# Build Environment :

<ul>
  <li> Windows x64  </li>
  <li> Python 3.6.7  </li>
  <li> Numpy  </li>
  <li> Matplotlib  </li>
</ul>
